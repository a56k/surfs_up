## Overview of the analysis
    The analysis seeks to capture temperature trends that would provide more information before opening the surf shop. Specifically, we are tasked to gather temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
    By following similar steps in class to obtain the temperature trends for the analysis, we're able to query data that provide an overview of June and December. 
    That said, the distinction in change of temperature is very samll for those two months. We notice that June has higher Temperature (avg, min, max) compared to december. The describe() method helps us capture these changes.

## Summary
    Running a ice scream shop year-round seems to be a tough task - However, with predictive analysis such as this one made availaible to Avy, he can plan his year by seasonality. Meaning, he can  deepen the analysis to capture the trends of customers buying certain types of ice cream during warm and cooler temperature. Then, adjust his product offering based on that data. He can segment his customers and still capture his desired business outcome.
